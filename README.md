# My Independent Project (PunaLink)

This project is designed to form a bridge (hence the name) between the current students and the alumni of Punahou School. It serves as a resource that the current students can use to learn information about a given college that is far more detailed and tailored for a Punahou student. Punahou alumni (who are currently in college or have graduated) will be able to fill out a survey/form that contains questions which are specifically geared towards answering this question: what would a *Punahou* student like (or dislike) about this college.
